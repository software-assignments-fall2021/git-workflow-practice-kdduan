# Ten Rules for Negotiating a Job Offer

Many people view "getting a job" as simply acquiring a resource out in the world. I used to fall into this group as well. However, this mindset is completely backwards and counterintuitive. When you're looking for a job, you're actually selling your labor and various companies are simply bidding for it. Looking at recruiting from this perspective can completely change your feelings towards negotiation. Instead of being grateful to the first company that has "gifted" you a scarce resource, you're instead trying to get the best value for your labor and time.

[This](https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/) article goes through ten very helpful tips on how to approach negotiation and reframe your mindset towards it. The author also provides plenty of examples for what to write in an email or what to say during a phone call with recruiters. In general, it's a helpful reference for when you're talking about offer details and you want to give yourself the best results possible.

### Comment from Janet Huang (@janethuangg)

I feel like during the recruiting season, students, including myself, often fall into the mindset that they are "desparate" to land an offer. This was a much needed reminder that we should value our skills and put ourselves on the same level as the companies we strive to work at. If anyone is interested in learning more about negotiation tactics, I've heard great things about the book "Never Split the Difference."
